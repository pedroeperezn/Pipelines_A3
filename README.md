# Pipelines_A3 - PG24Pedro

This app can read audio files inside a selected folder, display the list of mp3 and wav files on the directory and orginze them
into their own separate folders.

Testing:
Open the project on Visual Studio 2022, build and run the app. 
Click the "Browse for Directory" button and select a directory in which you have audio files. 
Click "Refresh Files" in order to show the files on the List View. 
Click "Organize Audio Files" for the tool to separate your files between wav and mp3 files. 

Inside the project folder, there's a "TestAudioFiles" folder which can be used for testing. It also contains .jpeg files to demonstrate that it only checks for the audio .wav and .mp3 files. 


Enjoy!
Kind regards
